# Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a simple Python "Hello World" program that demonstrates basic Python script structure and execution. The project consists of a single executable Python file that prints "Hello World" to the console when run. It serves as a minimal example of Python programming fundamentals and script organization.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: The entire application consists of one Python file (`hello_world.py`)
- **Functional design**: Uses a simple function-based approach with a `main()` function as the entry point
- **Standard Python conventions**: Follows Python best practices with proper shebang, docstrings, and the `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern

### Design Patterns
- **Entry point pattern**: Uses the standard Python idiom `if __name__ == "__main__"` to ensure the script runs only when executed directly
- **Documentation pattern**: Includes module-level and function-level docstrings for code documentation
- **Executable script pattern**: Includes shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) for direct execution on Unix-like systems

### Runtime Environment
- **Python 3**: Designed to run with Python 3 interpreter
- **Console output**: Uses standard output for displaying results
- **No external frameworks**: Pure Python implementation without additional dependencies

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Python 3**: Requires Python 3 interpreter (specified in shebang)

### Development Dependencies
- None - this is a standalone Python script with no external libraries or frameworks

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x
- **No database**: No data persistence or database requirements
- **No network services**: No external APIs or network connectivity required
